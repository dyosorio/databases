1. Create MongoDB Atlas account

2. Create cluster

3. Create User

4. IP Whitelist - add current IP or allow access from anywhere (this was my option for the homework)

5. open mysql terminal and type the commands to migrate the tables into Atlas MongoDB

6. Got error and fixed it 
ERROR 1290 (HY000): The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement
Fix it by adding the following line to my.cnf file:
secure_file_priv    = ''

7. Import Database to CSV
select * into outfile 'city.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' from city;
select * into outfile 'country.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' from country;
select * into outfile 'countrylanguage.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' from countrylanguage;

8. Add new row into the CSV files. Add column names in the first line of each file.

9. create collection in MongoDB Compass. Double check the datatypes and import data.

10. Go to the browser, to the Atlas MongoDB account, refresh and under Collections I found my database world and documents city, country and countrylanguage

The end.
